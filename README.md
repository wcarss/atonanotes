A tool to memorize notes of different clefs etc. -- https://wcarss.ca/atonanotes

## What's this?

I built this simple quizzer tool to learn the notes of the bass clef. It chooses clef, puts 5-10 unlabeled notes on it, and proceeds across the staff as you type in letters that correspond to those notes. When you get to the end of them, it restarts. As you type, it briefly shows you the note that you entered to help reinforce it.
